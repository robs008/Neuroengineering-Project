# EEG Signals â€“ Active Visual Oddball Stimuli  
### Analysis of P300 Amplitude and Latency  

This repository contains the project developed for the course in **Neuroengineering**.  
The study investigates the **P300 event-related potential (ERP)**, a positive deflection in the EEG that occurs when subjects are exposed to specific stimuli under defined conditions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Focus:** Analysis of **P300 amplitude and latency** in response to active visual oddball stimuli.  
- **Participants:** 40 neurotypical young adult subjects.  
- **Methods:** EEG recordings with 30 electrodes (10â€“20 system), preprocessing (filters, referencing, artifact reduction), and statistical analysis using MATLAB.  
- **Paradigm:** Oddball paradigm with rare "target" stimuli versus frequent "standard" stimuli.  
- **Analysis:** Amplitude, latency, and topographic distribution of P300 responses.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Findings
- P300 amplitude is significantly higher in **oddball events** compared to standard events.  
- The **latency** of P300 varies between 250â€“750 ms, reflecting decision-making processes.  
- **Topographic maps** revealed spatial variations in P300 distribution across the scalp.  
- No significant differences were found between male and female participants.
